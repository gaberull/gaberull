### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile!**

I am a recent Computer Science graduate and new software engineer, currently looking for software development work in the Austin, TX area, and/or remote work.

## Repositories of mine to check out:

- [Counting Cards](https://github.com/gaberull/CountingCards) A blackjack strategy and card counting game with lots of fun features.
- [Pet Awesome Promotional Email Template](https://github.com/gaberull/gaberull.github.io) Some professional HTML, CSS work I did for Pet-Awesome Pet Products
  - [Viewable HTML Email Template](https://gaberull.github.io) Email viewable in webpage format
- Lost and Found Database, Website, and Android Application for the University of Oklahoma
  - This was my OU Capstone project and the repository is currently private, due to some private keys being hard-coded into the code by a classmate of mine. If you would like to view this project, please ask me to add you as a contributor, and I will be happy to do so.
- [Super Sudoku](https://github.com/gaberull/SuperSudoku) A sudoku game with front-end and back-end development
  - Project that I contributed to with a group of people. The goal was to design and add a front-end user interface to a backend Sudoku game
  
## Current Projects
- I am currently working on building a front end graphical user interface for the CountingCards game that I made. I am working in React Native and Javascript, attempting to run on mobile devices, and connecting the React code to my C++ backend linked above.

#### School Assignment Respositories:

These repositories were never really meant to be shown off. They were made while I was learning git and completing various assignments at OU. They may or may not have README files with information about them.

- [Project2 Data Structures](https://github.com/gaberull/DataStructProject2) - One of the main projects for my Data Structures class at OU
