### Hi there 👋

**Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile!**

## About Me   😄

I am a recent Computer Science graduate and new software engineer, currently looking for software development work in the Austin, TX area, and/or remote work. I primarily focus on back-end development, but also enjoy software design and front-end development.

## Current Projects

- **Front-end and GUI for [CountingCards](https://github.com/gaberull/CountingCards) blackjack game**
  - I am working in React Native and Javascript
  - I Plan to release it for iOS and Android as well as a freestanding computer app
  - My React and JavaScript code will connect to my backend C++ code

## 😄 Check out some of my repositories :

- [Counting Cards](https://github.com/gaberull/CountingCards) 
  - My most recent project! A blackjack strategy and card counting game with lots of fun features. This was a personal project, completed by myself. 
  - Written in C++
- [Pet Awesome Promotional Email Template](https://github.com/gaberull/gaberull.github.io) 
  - Some professional HTML, CSS work that I did as contract work for Pet-Awesome Pet Products. The company is still using my work, and having great success with it from what I've heard.
  - [Viewable HTML Email Template](https://gaberull.github.io) - Email template viewable in webpage format
- [Super Sudoku](https://github.com/gaberull/SuperSudoku) A sudoku game with front-end and back-end development
  - Project that I contributed to with a group of people. The goal was to design and add a front-end user interface to a backend Sudoku game
- **Lost and Found Database, Website, and Android Application Prototype** for the University of Oklahoma
  - This was my OU Capstone project! The repository is currently private, due to some private keys being hard-coded into the files by a classmate of mine. 
  - This project had 7 teams, and a large number of contributors, of which I contributed the 2nd highest number of commits. 
  - ***If you would like to view this project, please ask me to add you as a contributor, and I will be happy to do so!***
