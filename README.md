## About Me   🙂

I am a recent Computer Science graduate and new software engineer, currently looking for software development work in the Austin, TX area, and/or remote work. I primarily focus on back-end development, but also enjoy software design and front-end development.

## Current Projects   📂

- **[CountingCards](https://github.com/gaberull/CountingCards) blackjack game**
  - Currently tweaking the backend game engine, and building the front-end and GUI for this fun blackjack and card counting game that I made.
  - For the front-end, I am working in React Native and Javascript, back-end is written in C++.
  - I Plan to release it for iOS and Android as well as a freestanding computer app
